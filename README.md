# Human-Computer-Interaction
COVID-19 has disrupted our lives and daily routines. This project aims to address psychosocial support for adolescents and children during the pandemic and post-pandemic phase. Research shows that youth behavior and thinking, often marked by risky behavior and reduced self-regulation, can be attributed to their developmental stage, in which their brains are not yet fully developed. This is important for family and caregivers of adolescents to understand and consider; teens in particular may struggle to socially distance themselves from their peer networks and may not be equipped emotionally and socially to deal with the uncertainties that come with the epidemic. Our project supports the mental health of adolescents by creating opportunities for them to talk about how they feel, trying to understand and validate what they are experiencing, and by helping them to access professional support when needed.
